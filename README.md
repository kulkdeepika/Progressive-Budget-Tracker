# Aim
For an avid traveller or someome with not-so-great internet connection, being able to access some of the main functions of an app, is valuable. With turning our budget tracker into a Progressive Web App, we allow the user to view data and log their expenses even in the absence of internet connection, thus providing a near seamless experience.

# Usage
Enter the name of the expense and the amount spent, and click on add or subtract button. Two expenses can have the same name. You will be shown a graph illustrating your balance. In the absence of internet, the data you entered will be availabe once you come back online.
